repair-tracker
==============

Mobile phone repair tracking system

This project is inteneded to be used as a repair tracking system.  This project is mostly just a brain child at this point but I will be adding to it as I am able to.  The main goal of the project is to learn about web development, Python, Django and everything that associated with them.  As the project progresses I will reevaluate my approach but eventually I would like to make this a freely available app for those that wish to use it for their own repair tracking projects.

Right now the project is still getting off the ground so I will come back and revise this with installation and usage instructions but for now everything is still under development so there isn't much functionality.
